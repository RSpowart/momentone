# Moment One Platform
Moment One creates a safe environment for our users and enables them to build self- awareness by giving them the necessary tools and interactions to achieve this. We’re working with leading psychologists across Europe to leverage modern technology and to create this highly secure wellbeing solution.

The primary function of the platform would consist of allowing users seeking to build self-awareness to sign-up anonymously and being able to create bite-sized journal moments on a regular basis. In order to further help individuals, recognise recurring patterns, therapists will sign up on the platform and be able to provide feedback on a weekly basis using micro interactions. 

The platform will also feature user journeys as part of our gamification system which involves users needing to post 5x a week and complete the week’s interactive learning content (Created by Psychologists) to unlock the new level and continue on their self-awareness journey to subsequent levels. 

In addition, all users on the platform can view the different moments on a community feed and also earn points for each moment they post daily and for completely weekly journeys. Furthermore, the users with most points will be listed on our Leaderboard page. Also, each individual user will have their own dedicated profile with their post timelines as well as a data graphs based on their growth. 

Finally, there should be a possibility to integrate an AI advisor within the platform in the future as that’s the next stage of our development, so a scalable architecture is fundamental.
